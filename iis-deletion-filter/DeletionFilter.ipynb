    "# Irreducible Infeasible Set (IIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a large optimization problem is infeasible, it is very common that infeasibility can be localized to a small subset of mutually contradicting constraints. Locating such a small set can help better understand and, if needed, correct the infeasibility issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *Irreducible Infeasible Subset* (IIS) is, by definition, an infeasible set of constraints such that all its proper subset are feasible. It is therefore a minimal witness of infeasibility. Every infeasible problem has one or more IIS, which may be disjoint or overlapping and can be of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we implement a standard method of locating an IIS for linear programs (LPs), namely a *Deletion Filter*. (see [Feasibility and Infeasibility in Optimization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-74932-7)). This algorithm is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize $S$ to be the set of all constraints.\n",
    "- Iterate over all constraints and temporarily remove each from $S$:\n",
    "    - If the problem is still infeasible, then permanently remove this constraint from $S$.\n",
    "    - If the problem becomes feasible, then put the constraint back to $S$.\n",
    "- After iterating through all constraints return $S$ as the IIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see the algorithm will solve as many intermediate problems as there are constraints. If the IIS is small, as it often happens, then the intermediate problems will quickly shrink in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many implementation details which we discuss later, together with the code."

    "There are many MOSEK-specific implementation details which we now outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We work with the Optimizer API for Python and objects of class ``mosek.Task``. \n",
    "- Instead of creating a new task for each iteration of the algorithm we re-use the same task object. \n",
    "- Instead of removing constraints from $S$ we make them unbounded by setting their ``boundkey`` to be open in the direction we are testing thus *effectively removing* the bound. When a constraint is supposed to return to $S$ we just restore the original bound.\n",
    "- We initialize $S$ with all the effective bounds in the problem: variable upper/lower bounds and constraint upper/lower bounds. A fixed or ranged bound is treated as two bounds (upper and lower) so each of them can participate in the IIS independently. \n",
    "- We use the simplex solver to allow efficient hot-starts since we will be solving many similar linear problems sequentially.\n",
    "- We allow infeasible linear problems and mixed-integer linear problems whose root relaxation is infeasible."
