# Max-volume axis-parallel cuboid inscribed in a Regular Icosahedron

This notebook presents an exercise in using affine conic constraints and the geometric mean cone (introduced as a standalone domain in v10). We implement the maximum volume cuboid example discussed in the MOSEK modelling cookbook, section 4.3.2.
