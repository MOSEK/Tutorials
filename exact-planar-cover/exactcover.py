    ### Problem formulation

    In the *exact planar covering problem* we are given an $n\times m$ rectangle (possibly with holes) and a collection of shapes (bricks). We ask if the rectangle can be tightly covered (without overlaps) with the given shapes. For example, can a $21\times 21$ square be divided into $1\times 8$ and $1\times 9$ rectangles (allowing rotations)? Variants of the problem involve limited or unlimited number of bricks, maximizing the covered area, counting the coverings, etc. We assume that the shapes are built from unit squares and only consider grid-aligned coverings. See for instance the articles on [Polyominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino) and [Tetrominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino).

    A shape is defined as a list of unit squares, or rather offsets with respect to one fixed square, for example:

    ### Integer optimization model

    We can model the covering problem as a linear problem with binary variables in a standard way. Let $x_{ijk}\in\{0,1\}$ be a binary variable which takes value $1$ if a brick of shape $k$ is anchored at position $(i,j)$ and $0$ otherwise. 

    We have the variable bounds 

    $$x_{ijk}=0$$ 

    whenever the corresponding brick placement is forbidden (hangs out of the board or covers a removed hole). 

    Let us write briefly *$ijk$ covers $pq$* if a brick of type $k$, placed at $(i,j)$, covers the square $(p,q)$. Then  in the exact covering problem we have the constraints 

    $$\sum_{i,j,k~:~ijk\textrm{ covers }pq}=1$$

    for every position $(p,q)$ on the board which is available (not a hole). In the maximal area covering we need the inequality

    $$\sum_{i,j,k~:~ijk\textrm{ covers }pq}\leq 1.$$

    That guarantees each grid square present is covered exactly once (resp. at most once).

    To express the problem in Optimizer API we need a linear indexing of the variables $x_{ijk}$ and of the constraints. Assuming the number of brick shapes is $t$, we can do for example:

        return p * _m + q
    return encodeBrick, encodePos


@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):
    mo.md(
        r"""
    Note that the linear constraints have the form 

    $$Ax=b$$ 

    where $A$ is the adjacency matrix between bricks and positions, i.e. $A_{ijk,pq}=1$ if $ijk$ covers $pq$. The matrix $A$ has $nm$ rows and $nmt$ columns, corresponding to positions and anchored bricks, respectively. That makes it very easy to define $A$ column by column by listing the positions covered by a given anchored shape.

    As a small extension we can for example limit the number of times each shape is used. This requires constraints

    $$\sum_{i,j}x_{ijk}\leq r, \textrm{ for all } k=1,\ldots,t.$$

    ### Combinatorial interpretation of infeasibility

    In some cases the integer problem is declared as infeasible already because its linear relaxation is infeasible. This case deserves some attention in our example. The linear relaxation of the exact covering problem has the form

    $$
    \begin{array}{l}
    Ax = b, \\
    x\geq 0,
    \end{array}
    $$

    where $A$ is the adjacency matrix discussed previously and $b$ is the characteristic vector of available positions on the board.

    Standard duality for linear programing and Farkas lemma imply that a [certificate of primal infeasibility](http://docs.mosek.com/modeling-cookbook/linear.html#infeasibility-in-linear-optimization) is a vector $y$ satisfying

    $$
    \begin{array}{l}
    A^Ty \geq 0, \\
    b^Ty < 0.
    \end{array}
    $$

    It means that an infeasibility certificate is an assignment of a real number to every position on the board so that:

    * every possible placement of a single brick covers positions with non-negative sum
    * the sum of all numbers on the board is negative

    It is combinatorially obvious that the existence of such an assignment implies an exact covering does not exist (unfortunately not vice-versa since the covering problem is NP-hard in general; in other words integer infeasibility does not imply continuous infeasibility).

    It is very easy to compute a relaxed infeasibility certificate, if one exists. All we need to do is reoptimize the task changing all integer variables to continuous ones and read off the certificate stored in the dual variables corresponding to constraints.
